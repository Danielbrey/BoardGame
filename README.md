# BoardGame

This app will help the user find board games they like. By plugging in your game preferences, such as playing time and game category, it will show the top five games. There is also data analysis done on the correlations between different measurements (such as number of players, game complexity, and game length).

Note: I had to remove a lot of the data (selecting only the necessary columns and taking away those that were not owned by more than a certain amount of people) to make it fit into a usable dataset.
